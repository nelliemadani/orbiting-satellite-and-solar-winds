# orbiting-satellite-and-solar-winds

Assume that a satellite orbiting Earth is affected not only by Earth's gravitational force, but also a weak solar wind of magnitude W. Assume the solar wind is constant in magnitude and direction. Choose initial conditions for the satellite such that if W=0, the orbit is circular. The magnitude of W should be about 1% of the gravitational force in a circular orbit.
